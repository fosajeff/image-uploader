<!-- OVERVIEW -->

## Overview

![screenshot](https://image-uploader-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/image-uploader.gif)

This application was built with React on the Frontend and Nodejs | Typescript on the backend. Link to a live demo can be found here [here](https://peejay-image-uploader.netlify.app/).

It was fun to build!!

One of my challenge initially was setting up AWS S3 on the backend and Multer with Typescript for file uploads, but it was exciting!

I was able to improve my knowledge of using Typescript with Nodejs/Express on the backend and linking my application to AWS using [aws-sdk/client-s3](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@aws-sdk/client-s3). Moving on to the next fullstack challenge!!

A useful tip:
Anytime you get stuck, do some googling, read docs, take some break, and the problem will be easier to solve!
